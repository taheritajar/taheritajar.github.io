I had the honor of presenting my research on "Your Typing Style Leaks: What Are You Typing?" at AFCEA TechNet 2023. The presentation focused on acoustic side-channel attacks on keyboards and how individual typing patterns can be exploited for security vulnerabilities.

I received a certification of appreciation from the CSM, U.S. Army Command Sergeant Major, and Major General, U.S. Army Commanding General. This recognition motivates me to continue exploring cybersecurity challenges in human-computer interaction.

The presentation sparked interesting discussions about practical security implications and potential countermeasures. I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this research with the military and defense community.
