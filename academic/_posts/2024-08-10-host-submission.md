Excited to share that we've submitted our paper "Acoustic Side Channel Attack on Keyboards Based on Typing Style of Users" to the International Conference on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST 2025).

This research explores how individual typing patterns and styles can be exploited in acoustic side-channel attacks on keyboards. We demonstrate that user-specific characteristics in typing behavior can significantly enhance the accuracy of such attacks.

The paper is a collaboration with Dr. Reza Rahaeimehr and represents my continued interest in cybersecurity research, particularly focusing on side-channel vulnerabilities in human-computer interaction.

The preprint is available on arXiv for those interested in learning more about this work!
