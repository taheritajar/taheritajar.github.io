Thrilled to announce that our paper "A lightweight Tiny-YOLOv3 vehicle detection approach" has been published in the Journal of Real-Time Image Processing!

This paper presents the work from my Master's thesis, where we developed an optimized version of Tiny-YOLOv3 specifically designed for real-time vehicle detection. The approach balances detection accuracy with computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Key highlights:
- Lightweight architecture for edge deployment
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Maintained high detection accuracy
- Practical applications in intelligent transportation systems

This publication was a collaborative effort with Dr. A. Ramazani and Dr. M. Mansoorizadeh at Bu-Ali Sina University. The work has applications in traffic monitoring, automated toll systems, and smart city infrastructure.
