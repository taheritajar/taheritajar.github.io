I'm excited to announce that I have started my Ph.D. program in Computer Science and Cyber Security at Augusta University's Georgia Cyber Center!

I will be working under the supervision of Dr. Jason Orlosky at the AR-VR lab, focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence and computer vision with Extended Reality (XR). This is an incredible opportunity to work on cutting-edge research at the intersection of computer vision, mixed reality, and AI.

I'm looking forward to contributing to innovative research projects and collaborating with talented researchers in the field. The Georgia Cyber Center provides an excellent environment for cybersecurity and computing research.

My research interests include:
- Mixed Reality applications
- Computer Vision for XR
- AI-powered immersive systems
- Cybersecurity in emerging technologies

Stay tuned for updates on my research progress!
