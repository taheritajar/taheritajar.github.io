We've submitted our paper "Scalable Object Detection in Mixed Reality using Incremental Re-training and One-shot 3D Annotation" to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).

This work presents a novel approach for scalable object detection in mixed reality environments. Our method addresses the challenges of efficiently annotating 3D objects and incrementally training detection models for XR applications.

Key contributions include:
- One-shot 3D annotation technique for MR environments
- Incremental re-training methodology for object detectors
- Scalability analysis for real-world deployment

This is a collaborative effort with Jeffrey Benson, Brandon Wilburn, Jieqiong Zhao, and my advisor Dr. Jason Orlosky. Fingers crossed for positive reviews!
