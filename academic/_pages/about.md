I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Cyber Security at Augusta University-Georgia Cyber Center, where I work under the supervision of Dr. Jason Orlosky at the AR-VR lab. My research focuses on the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision with Extended Reality (XR). I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of Mixed Reality, Computer Vision, Robotics, and AI Cyber Security.

## Research Interests

* **Mixed Reality** - Developing innovative XR applications and experiences
* **Computer Vision** - Object detection, classification, and scene understanding
* **Robotics** - Autonomous systems and intelligent agents
* **AI Cyber Security** - Side-channel attacks and security vulnerabilities

## Background

I earned my Master of Science in Electrical and Control Engineering from Bu-Ali Sina University in Iran, where I focused on vehicle detection and classification using computer vision techniques. Before joining Augusta University, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at Experts Group (AIEX) in Montreal, Canada, where I developed AI-based frameworks for visual industrial inspection on edge devices and GPU servers.
